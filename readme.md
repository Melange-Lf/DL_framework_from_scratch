# DL Framework Hardcoded

## Overview

Placeholder overview

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `func.py`: T
- `layers.py`: Co
- `model.py`: Thi
- `requirements.txt`: Con
- `sandbox.ipynb`: A Ju
- `templates.ipynb`: A J


## Prerequisites

The required libaries can be installed using the requirements file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Current Progress


## Usage

The current relevant files to build the model can be found in model.py, layers.py and func.py.

All classes in the layers file are to be used directly, but most the files in functions files are used internally for different layers.

In the future, once more loss functions, optimizers, and activations are added, futher subdivision can be made.

```python
from model import Model
import func
import layers
```
